Float : Float is used to make an element float right or left of next element
Float will remove the element from actual flow
float : left/right/none;

When an element is floated it is removed from the normal document and positioned left or right of the parent element. So the surroundings will just wrap around floated element

Clearing the floats : when using float it's necessary to clear the float to prevent elements wrapping around
clear : left/right/both

Initially float is used for multi-column layout
