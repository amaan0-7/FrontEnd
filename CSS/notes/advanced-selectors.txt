Advanced Selector : we can select elements in CSS using multiple ways. Basic ways are tagname, .classname, #idname

child selector : used to select an element which is an immediate child of parent
    parent > child{--}

descendant of parent : 
    parent child

immediate sibling : 
    element1 + element2

multiple selectors : 
    selector1,selector2

pseudo classes : these elements are selectors used to select elements based on their state or position. Most commonly used are
    1. :hoover -- it selects the element when mouse is over the element
    2. :active -- it selects the element(link) when it gets clicked
    3. :visited -- it selects element(link) when it is already visited
    4. :focus -- it selects the input when it gets focused
    5. :first-child -- it selects element which is first child of its parent
    6. :last-child -- it selects element which is last child of its parent
    7. :nth-child(number) -- it selects element which is nth child of parent
    8. :nth-last-child(number) -- it selects element which is nth child of parent from last
we can also use "even" or "odd" instead of number to select specific elements

Similarly there are so many pseudo classes such as :required,:optional,:enabled,:disabled,:readonly,:read-write,:empty,:not e.t.c...
