Transitions are used to control an element when it is transforming from one state to another state
It contains
    Transition property
    Transition Duration
    Transition Timing Function
    Transition Delay

Transition property : It contains property names that need to have transition.'all' covers all properties
Transition Duration : It defines the time the transition takes(in seconds or milliseconds)
Transition Timing Function : It defines how the transition should go.There are different functions,the popular ones are:
    linear -- maintains constant growth
    ease -- maintains explosive growth
    ease-in -- starts slowly and gains speed
    ease-out -- starts fastly and becomes slow
    ease-in-out -- starts slowly and becomes fastly and becomes slow

Animations : Animations are used to show the transition of element between multiple states
They need keyframes to defines its each frame. Animations properties are
    Animation name
    Animation Duration
    Animation Timing Function
